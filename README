Project for analysing tibial subchondral bone pixel values from t1 spin echo MRI images.


LBP functions downloaded from Center for Machine Vision Research website (http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads)

N.B. it is rather questionable whether subchondral bone pixel intensities may give any useful information, as e.g. osteoarthritis is known to be associated with oedema, which will cause lower pixel intensities than seen in healthy tissue...

Currently trying to automate segmenting trabecular bone from the images. Working on using LBP textural analysis as outlined in (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/mvmp/mvg/files/pdf/pdf_6.pdf). Added just regular histogram to the measures, as the image indices are normalized b the MRI device and similar tissue produce similar pixel values in different subjects.

Segmentation attempts:

Tried LBP analysis with 16x16 samples. Worked to a rough estimate (with proper parameters and boundary conditions, e.g. the largest volume, which has the centre of volume low enough in the image). Tried flood filling to refine the segmentation. Didn't work, as I couldn't come up with proper and robust conditions for expanding the volume of interest.

Tried min filter to enhance borders, didn't work...

Tried 3x3x3 volumetric min filter, didn't work...

TODO NEXT
Try segmenting the images in other planes than what they were originally measured in. The in plane voxel size differs from out of plane voxel size by a factor of 10. Visual inspection seems to suggest that the chance of success might be better in other directions.
