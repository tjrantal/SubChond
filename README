Project for analysing tibial subchondral bone pixel values from t1 spin echo MRI images.


LBP functions downloaded from Center for Machine Vision Research website (http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads)

N.B. it is rather questionable whether subchondral bone pixel intensities may give any useful information, as e.g. osteoarthritis is known to be associated with oedema, which will cause lower pixel intensities than seen in healthy tissue...

Currently trying to automate segmenting trabecular bone from the images. Working on using LBP textural analysis as outlined in (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/mvmp/mvg/files/pdf/pdf_6.pdf). Added just regular histogram to the measures, as the image indices are normalized b the MRI device and similar tissue produce similar pixel values in different subjects.

Tried flood filling. Didn't work.

Tried min filter to enhance borders. Might work..

TODO NEXT
Try segmenting the images in other planes than what they were originally measured in. The in plane voxel size differs from out of plane voxel size by a factor of 10. Visual inspection seems to suggest that the chance of success might be better in other directions.

Perhaps 3x3x3 volumetric sample -> mean/stdev as measures

Calculate 3x3x3 sample means from stacks filtered with 3D min filter!! Continue work from visualizeSlicePlanesMinFilter! 3D filter didn't actually work...
