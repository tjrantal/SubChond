Project for analysing tibial subchondral bone pixel values from t1 spin echo MRI images.

Currently trying to automate segmenting trabecular bone from the images. Working on using LBP textural analysis as outlined in (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/mvmp/mvg/files/pdf/pdf_6.pdf).

LBP functions downloaded from Center for Machine Vision Research website (http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads)

N.B. it is rather questionable whether subchondral bone pixel intensities may give any useful information, as e.g. osteoarthritis is known to be associated with oedema, which will cause lower pixel intensities than seen in healthy tissue...
