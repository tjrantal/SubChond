Project for analysing tibial subchondral bone pixel values from t1 spin echo MRI images.


LBP functions downloaded from Center for Machine Vision Research website (http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads)

N.B. it is rather questionable whether subchondral bone pixel intensities may give any useful information, as e.g. osteoarthritis is known to be associated with oedema, which will cause lower pixel intensities than seen in healthy tissue...

Currently trying to automate segmenting trabecular bone from the images. Working on using LBP textural analysis as outlined in (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/mvmp/mvg/files/pdf/pdf_6.pdf). Added just regular histogram to the measures, as the image indices are normalized b the MRI device and similar tissue produce similar pixel values in different subjects.

TODO NEXT
Grow region into neighboring slices from there and dilate if necessary to include voxels missed by the segmentation.

Test whether simply using 3D neighbourhood histogram suffices for segmentation. 3D LBP might be more useful than the 2D LBP used thus far.
